**Complete 708 support**

708 is the standard for digital TV in the US and a few other countries. We have preliminary support, but the goal is a 100% accurate implementation. This means:

a) Perfect timing.\\
b) Perfect rendering, limited only by the output format.\\
c) Full support to all languages for which samples are available.\\

We will provide hundreds of samples (for which you must complete support, no exceptions) and access to a high speed linux server for you to work with if needed. These samples are usually very large (hundreds of megabytes each) so working locally may not be feasible for you if you don't have a great internet connection.

For developers in India we have someone there with an external 2 TB drive with a copy of all our samples. That drive goes from developer to developer, so if needed we can get it shipped to you.

If you are not in India or in a country in which just downloading the samples is the easy way, get in touch. We'll figure something out so access to media is not a problem.

This is a high value task and we'd love to have it done, but in order to qualify you need to fix some of the existing bugs.

Also part of this idea:\\

Which is about implementing .mcc support, which as the GitHub ticket says complements 708 very well.

Getting started: 

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEA-708|The wikipedia page on 708]] This is quite good actually. It's not a complete description of the standard, but it's quite useful to understand what 708 is about.\\

__**Mentors**__\\
Carlos Fernandez Sanz (@carlos.fernandez on slack). Carlos wrote the original CEA-708 code.\\
Evgeny Shulgin (@izaron on slack). Evgeny is a 2016 Code-In Winner with CCExtractor, and worked a lot on CEA-708.\\

__**How to get started**__\\
Best thing you can do is download a few samples ([[public:general:tvsamples|check our TV samples page]]) and try to solve some of the CEA-708 issues we have listed on GitHub.

This is also the best way to get accepted into GSoC.
